/**
 * A single, mod-owned bank account that "sink" payments (upkeep, chunk-claim
 * price, and so on) deposit into instead of destroying the money outright -
 * see SPEC.md's "server money account" feature request.
 * <p>
 * Backed by a real LC {@link PlayerBankReference} bound to a fixed, non-
 * player UUID - {@code PlayerBankReference.of(UUID)} never requires that UUID
 * to actually belong to a player, it's just the storage key
 * {@code BankDataCache.getAccount(UUID)} auto-creates an account under on
 * first access (confirmed via decompile - the same lazy-vivify path every
 * personal account already goes through, e.g. {@code PlayerBankReference.of(player.getUUID())}
 * elsewhere in this codebase). So this is a genuine, persistent
 * {@link IBankAccount} using LC's own machinery, not a bespoke one.
 * <p>
 * Access: {@code PlayerBankReferenceOpAccessMixin} widens
 * {@code PlayerBankReference.allowedAccess(Player)} to also accept any
 * vanilla-OP player (permission level 2+) specifically for THIS account's
 * UUID - deliberately not LC's own Admin Mode, which (confirmed via
 * decompile) grants access to every player's personal account at once, not
 * just this one. Every op can reach this account through LC's real ATM UI
 * once they select it, no custom banking screen needed. See
 * {@code ServerAccountCommand} for the one custom piece: pointing an op's
 * currently-selected account at this one, since there's no real player name
 * to type into LC's own admin account-search field.
